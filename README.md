# magicEightBall
In this project we will build a Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.  The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.

-Each step in code has a single line comment describing the code!

The code starts by Adding a Name.
Applying if...else statement for the magic ball greeting!
Applying a question to the magic ball, then generated a random number between 0 and 7
We created a control flow that takes in the randomNumber we made. 

And finally, printing out the random value
